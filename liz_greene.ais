# Sun = 1, Aries = 1 through Pisces = 12, Houses 1-12

# Sun in Aries (1)
1+1+1: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 1st House represents the purest expression of solar identity drive \
  with the initiatory fire of Aries, manifesting in the arena of self-formation. This configuration suggests \
  a powerful need to experience oneself as a distinct, autonomous force in the world. The ego is paramount here, \
  and there may be tension between authentic self-assertion and awareness of others. The shadow can manifest \
  as unconscious aggression or an inability to recognize one's dependence on others. Integration requires \
  learning that true autonomy requires recognition of interdependence.
1+1+2: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 2nd House places the drive for identity assertion within the realm of \
  values and material security. This suggests that self-worth is tied to the ability to assert one's will and \
  achieve tangible results. There may be a compulsive need to prove one's worth through accumulation or conquest. \
  The shadow can manifest as greed or the use of material resources to establish dominance. Integration involves \
  recognizing that true worth comes from within, not from external validation.
1+1+3: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 3rd House illuminates the mental realm with the fire of initiative. This \
  placement suggests that thinking itself becomes an act of will, and ideas are treated as territories to be \
  conquered. There may be a tendency toward aggressive communication or the need to be right in all debates. \
  The shadow can manifest as intellectual arrogance or the refusal to consider other perspectives. Integration \
  requires learning that the mind serves best when open rather than defensive.
1+1+4: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 4th House places the solar drive within the most private and unconscious \
  realm of the chart. This creates tension between the need for individual assertion and the conditioning of \
  family and psychological roots. There may be anger toward the father or the family structure, or a compulsion \
  to break free from the past. The shadow can manifest as emotional volatility or difficulty establishing a \
  sense of safety. Integration requires acknowledging that true independence includes honoring one's roots.
1+1+5: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 5th House represents the natural affinity of solar energy with the \
  realm of creative self-expression. This placement suggests that creativity itself becomes an act of identity \
  formation, and the individual may be drawn to dramatic forms of self-expression. There is often a powerful \
  need to be seen and recognized for one's unique contributions. The shadow can manifest as excessive \
  self-centeredness or the need for constant attention. Integration involves channeling this energy into \
  authentic creative expression rather than performance for validation.
1+1+6: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 6th House places the drive for identity assertion within the realm of \
  service, work, and daily routine. This suggests that work becomes a primary arena for self-definition, and \
  there may be a compulsion to prove oneself through achievement and productivity. The individual may be \
  highly energetic in work but prone to burnout through over-exertion. The shadow can manifest as workaholism \
  or the use of work to avoid deeper emotional issues. Integration requires learning that one's worth is \
  not solely defined by utility or achievement.
1+1+7: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 7th House creates a paradoxical placement, as the solar drive for \
  individual assertion operates within the realm of relationship and the other. This suggests that identity \
  is forged through relationship dynamics, and there may be a pattern of attracting partners who either \
  challenge or reflect one's need for autonomy. There can be difficulty balancing self-assertion with \
  partnership needs. The shadow can manifest as dominance in relationships or the loss of self in fusion \
  with others. Integration involves learning that true relationship requires two sovereign individuals.

  shadow, and shared resources. This is an intensely psychological placement that suggests the identity \
  is forged through experiences of death and rebirth, literal or symbolic. There may be a compulsion to \
  penetrate beneath surface reality and confront taboo realms. The shadow can manifest as obsession with \
  power or the use of intensity to avoid vulnerability. Integration requires channeling this transformative \
  energy into psychological depth and healing rather than destruction.
1+1+9: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 9th House illuminates the realm of higher mind, philosophy, and \
  the search for meaning with the fire of initiative. This suggests that belief systems themselves become \
  an expression of identity, and there may be a compulsion to convert others to one's truth. The individual \

  ideological fanaticism or the refusal to acknowledge other perspectives. Integration requires learning \

  is tied to professional success and public recognition. There may be a compulsion to be the leader or \
  authority figure in one's chosen field. The shadow can manifest as ruthless ambition or the sacrifice \
  of all other life areas to career demands. Integration involves balancing worldly achievement with \
  authentic inner purpose and relationship needs.

  realm of groups, friends, and collective vision. This suggests that the individual may express their \
  solar energy through group involvement or collective causes, often taking leadership roles. There may \
  be a tension between the need for individual recognition and group harmony. The shadow can manifest \
  as dominating group dynamics or the use of groups for self-aggrandizement. Integration involves \
  learning that true leadership serves the collective rather than the ego.
1+1+12: {person}'s Sun in Aries in the 12th House is a complex placement that places the conscious \
  ego drive within the realm of the unconscious, spirituality, and dissolution. This creates tension \
  between the need for individual assertion and the call to transcend separate identity. The individual \
  may experience their identity as diffuse or confusing, struggling between ego needs and spiritual \
  longing. The shadow can manifest as self-undoing through impulsive actions or difficulty with \
  boundaries. Integration requires accepting that the ego's ultimate purpose is to serve something \
  greater than itself.

[aspects]
# Liz Greene style aspect interpretations
# Format: aspect_key: interpretation text with %s placeholders
# Placeholders: %s%s = planet1 mind part, planet2 mind part (can use multiple times)

# Major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square, sextile)
Conjunct: is fused together with %s in an unconscious complex of energy that can manifest as both shadow and gift depending on level of awareness. This aspect represents the merging of two archetypal principles within the psyche, where the boundaries between them dissolve and they operate as a unified field. The shadow may appear as the inability to distinguish these principles or the compulsive fusion of their energies, while integration brings the conscious use of their combined power.
Opposite: is projected onto and engages in unconscious dialogue with %s, creating a polarized dynamic that often manifests through relationship and external circumstances. This aspect represents the split within the psyche that seeks integration through the mirror of the other, where what is disowned in one pole is encountered through the arena of the opposite. The evolutionary task is to withdraw projection and own both ends of the polarity, recognizing that the perceived enemy or obstacle is often an unintegrated aspect of self.
Trine: flows in harmonious connection with %s, representing natural talent and ease of expression that can manifest as both gift and trap. This aspect indicates areas where the planetary energies cooperate without conscious effort, potentially leading to complacency and over-reliance on natural abilities rather than the development of consciousness through struggle. The shadow can appear as laziness or taking gifts for granted, while integration involves the conscious and ethical use of these natural capacities.
Square: is in frustrating conflict with %s, creating an internal tension that demands confrontation and forces the development of new capacities. This aspect represents the clash of two archetypal wills that refuse easy reconciliation, manifesting as external obstacles, inner conflicts, or compulsive patterns that repeat until the lesson is integrated. The evolutionary gift of the square is the strength, depth, and authenticity that come from working constructively with rather than avoiding or repressing this fundamental internal conflict.
Sextile: engages in creative opportunity with %s, offering openings for growth and the development of new capacities through conscious attention and active engagement. This aspect represents potential rather than guaranteed manifestation, requiring the individual to recognize and work with opportunities rather than passively waiting for them to bear fruit. Integration involves the active cultivation of this aspect's promise through conscious choice and effort.

# Minor aspects
Inconjunct: is in awkward adjustment with %s, creating a subtle but persistent tension that demands resolution and often manifests as health issues, service to others, or the need to release old patterns. This aspect represents the disconnect between two archetypal principles that have no easy mode of expression together, forcing the individual to find creative solutions that honor both energies. Integration requires letting go of expectations and embracing the need for constant adjustment and adaptation.
SemiSextile: forms a bridge of potential with %s, suggesting latent connection and opportunity that requires conscious recognition to activate. This aspect represents a threshold state where two archetypal energies stand adjacent to each other, offering the possibility of integration through awareness and subtle attention rather than dramatic confrontation. The gift lies in recognizing and working with these subtle connections before they manifest as more compelling external events.
SesquiQuadrate: is in irritating friction with %s, creating minor but persistent stress that can accumulate over time and force constructive change. This aspect represents the background tension of two archetypal wills that cannot easily find common ground, manifesting as nagging dissatisfaction, compulsive tension, or the feeling that something is slightly off-center. Integration involves working patiently with this discomfort as a signal for necessary adjustment rather than suppressing or avoiding it.
SemiSquare: encounters blocked expression with %s, creating internal pressure and frustration that demands release and often manifests as external obstacles. This aspect represents the half-square, carrying the same quality of internal conflict and externalized struggle as the square but with less intensity and more subtlety. The evolutionary task is to confront this irritation constructively rather than allowing it to accumulate into resentment or passive-aggressive expression.
Quintile: joins in creative fusion with %s, indicating special talent, artistic or creative capacity, and the potential for inspired expression that defies conventional understanding. This aspect represents the fifth-harmonic connection between two archetypal principles, suggesting areas where the individual may channel their energies in uniquely creative or original ways that can be both gifted and isolating. Integration involves owning and consciously directing these creative capacities rather than being overwhelmed by their intensity or rejecting them as too strange.
BiQuintile: connects with %s through a creative doorway that suggests latent talent and the ability to bridge disparate energies in innovative ways. This aspect represents the creative potential that emerges from the tension between two archetypal principles, offering openings for original expression and the synthesis of seemingly contradictory qualities. The gift lies in recognizing and cultivating these creative opportunities rather than dismissing them as too subtle or unconventional.
